# velut
I have an Excel file of Latin vocabulary and query functionality, out of which I've made a web app using the MERN stack. This GitHub repo is publicly visible. The app is hosted by Render from the master branch, at https://www.velut.co.uk . There is also a json branch using Json data (without the Mongo connection), hosted by Netlify at https://velutjson.duncanritchie.co.uk .
