I have an Excel file of Latin vocabulary and query functionality, out of which I&rsquo;ve made a website using the MERN stack. This GitHub repo is publicly visible. The app is hosted by Render from the master branch, at https://www.velut.co.uk .<br/>
There is also a json branch using Json data (without the Mongo connection), hosted by Netlify at https://velutjson.duncanritchie.co.uk . It takes a while to load the data, and I&rsquo;ve not kept the data up-to-date, but there is some functionality that is not yet in the main Mongo-using site &mdash; i.e. multiword anagrams.<br/>
